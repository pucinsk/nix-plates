# Nix Plates 🧪✨

**Nix Plates** is a collection of boilerplates for various projects, all powered by **NixOS**. Whether you're spinning up a web app, setting up a development environment, or experimenting with new tech stacks, this repo provides clean, reusable templates to get you started quickly—without the hassle of dependency hell.

## Why Nix Plates?
- **Reproducibility** – Say goodbye to "works on my machine."
- **Lightweight** – No more bloated containers, just pure declarative environments.
- **Flexibility** – From backend services to CLI tools, we’ve got a plate for you.

## But Why Not Docker? 🐳
Because sometimes, **Docker is just too big of a whale to fry.** 🐋🔥
